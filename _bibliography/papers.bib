      abstract = { A new way of sharing beliefs for multi-agent coverage is proposed. The approach, Hierarchical Belief Sharing (HBS), is based on a multi-level clustering strategy in which agents dynamically form clusters (and clusters of clusters) that belong to a single hierarchical tree. Clusters compress and forward local observations through this tree, to their members and sibling clusters. This approach has the advantage of both reducing the total throughput required to maximize coverage, and simplifying the control policy by exploiting local-interactive structure in the global state space. Simulations of HBS under multi-agent coverage scenarios with heterogeneous targets are performed to test this hypothesis using potential-field motion-primitives. It is shown that HBS compares favorably to scenarios where agents observe the perfect global state, and even outperforms these scenarios for certain target distributions. The relevance of HBS to motion-planning via reinforcement learning is discussed. }

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
